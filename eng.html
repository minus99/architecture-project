                        in 2015 by a team of interdisciplinary minds with backgrounds in various fields and the common

                        their projects, showcasing them to thousands of audiences in 13 exhibitions in Turkey and
                        abroad. In
                        its fourth year, bang.prix is expanding beyond support for project-based development and
